synopsis: Aims to provide higher level functions for linear algebra and comes with wrappers around BLAS and LAPACKE.
description: Jalla aims at providing high level functions for linear algebra computations which
  should be fast and easy enough to use. Under the hood, BLAS and LAPACKE are used 
  (LAPACKE is a standard C interface to LAPACK which is part of LAPACK since version 3.4).
  Currently, I am adding new functions whenever I find some time. Please help, if you want to!
  Tests are still missing, and we need some nicer error reporting (nicer than exceptions).
