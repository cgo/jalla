Jalla aims at providing high level functions for linear algebra computations,
which should be fast and easy enough to use.
It also contains a Haskell wrapper for cblas and lapacke, a C interface for LAPACK written by Intel.
Jalla is written and maintained by Christian Gosch (github at goschs dot de) and
was started as a little project to learn Haskell.

Jalla (probably) needs ghc, it has not been tested with other Haskell implementations.
It is developed with ghc > 7.0.

You need to have CBLAS and LAPACK installed, e.g. by installing ATLAS generated libraries
on you computer. 
In Ubuntu, there are packages for CBLAS and LAPACK which you can install with apt-get,
synaptic, or any other such tool.
Lapacke must be compiled "by hand".

0. Get the jalla sources; say they are located in the directory "jalla/"
1. a) LAPACKE is part of LAPACK since version 3.4.
      If you have that version, use that. Otherwise, follow b).
   b) Get Lapacke at <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.tgz>
      or at <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_standard_c_language_apis_for_lapack>
2. Unpack lapacke into "jalla/lapacke"
3. Follow lapacke's instructions to build
   OR use the shiny new SCons file provided to build lapacke
   for use with jalla, which can be found in the lapacke/ sub-directory
   in the jalla source code.
   If you don't use the provided SCons file, 
   note that Jalla expects the LAPACKE_... naming scheme, i.e. LAPACKE in upper case,
   the rest in lower case. That scheme is called LAPACK_NAME_PATTERN_MC in the LAPACKE make.inc
   file.
   Jalla also expects the define LAPACK_COMPLEX_STRUCTURE in the same make.inc.
   This means that complex numbers are represented as C struct.   
4. In jalla/, call 
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    cabal haddock
5. Look at the (currently somewhat sparse) generated documentation

Please contact the author at github at goschs dot de if anything does not work!


Documentation
-------------
The haddock documentation is not complete and rather sparse.
This will change.


Status
------
The code may change in some places, and will definitely be growing as soon as I need more functionality.
Please let me know if you have suggestions.

Please also tell me if you have a greater interest in this project and want to participate!
