Jalla is a Haskell wrapper for cblas and lapacke, a C interface for LAPACK written by Intel.
Jalla is written and maintained by Christian Gosch (github at goschs dot de) and
was started as a little project to learn Haskell.

Jalla (probably) needs ghc, it has not been tested with other Haskell implementations.
It is developed with ghc > 7.0.

You need to have CBLAS and LAPACK installed, e.g. by installing ATLAS generated libraries
on you computer. 
In Ubuntu, there are packages for CBLAS and LAPACK which you can install with apt-get,
synaptic, or any other such tool.
Lapacke must be compiled "by hand".

0. Get the jalla sources; say they are located in the directory "jalla/"
1. Get Lapacke at <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.tgz>
   or at <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_standard_c_language_apis_for_lapack>
2. Unpack lapacke into "jalla/lapacke"
3. Follow lapacke's instructions to build
4. In jalla/, call 
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    cabal haddock
5. Look at the (currently somewhat sparse) generated documentation

Please contact the author at github at goschs dot de if anything does not work!


Documentation
-------------
The haddock documentation is not complete and rather sparse.
This will change.


Status
------
The code may change in some places, and will definitely be growing as soon as I need more functionality.
Please let me know if you have suggestions.

Please also tell me if you have a greater interest in this project and want to participate!
